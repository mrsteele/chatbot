# Simple AI Nextjs Chatbot

I made this as a test and you can check it out too.

This integrates with **api.ai** and can be used to setup a basic back and forth with your client.

### Demo

I have added a demo [here](https://chatbot.now.sh) pointing to an AI I created with API.ai.

### Setup

Run the following:

1. Run `npm i`
2. Create an `.env` file and add your **Developer access token**
api key like so:

```
APIAI_KEY=KEYHERE
```

3. Type `npm run dev` to run in dev mode (alternatively use `npm run start` to start in prod)

> **KEYHERE** can be replaced with your actual key.
